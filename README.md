## 👋 Hey there! This is Tyler.
I'm a maker by nature, a programmer by history, and a budding data science/machine learning by occupation.

To be frank, I've been neglecting my GitHub over the past few years.  Most of my work over that time has been closed source or proprietary.
Much of what you'll find here in terms of original content are repos from college, which doesn't reflect my current skillset.
However, I'm striving to make it more legible and current. So be on the lookout for new updates, interactive experiments, and maybe even a video or two!

In the meantime, here's a little about myself:

#### 👀 I’m interested in ...
  * Video games
  * Psychology
  * Philosophy
  * Cyberpunk themes and art
  * 3D Printing and CAD/CAM
  
#### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  * Reinforcement Learning techniques
  * Transformers; Attention and Self-Attention methods in general
  
#### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
  * Interesting projects involving Reinforcement Learning -- especially video game or "experience" applications
  * Virtual beings
  
#### 📫 Get in touch!
  * @tpedelose on GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.
  * pedelose.1[at]gmail.com
